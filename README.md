# AI-Weather-forecaster
LinearRegression trained model predicting weather based on provided data (sklearn + pandas + numpy + matplotlib)

## Details
1. weather.xls is just a xls tables filled with dates + weather stats(tempreture, etc), 
2. you could use any xls or exel based data files with weather metrics to feed the models.
3. it will be trained & then predict specific weather data in the future. Use mean_squared_error or any others to adjust the result. 

I was using Moscow city weather data to build the model, you're able to use any city all around the globe.
